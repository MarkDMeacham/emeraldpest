Power-Spray

By applying our product to the exterior of your home using our premium power-spray equipment we are able to not only treat the pests you see, but the ones you don’t. The micro-encapsulated product is time released and soaks into the ground and reaches pests where they live and breed, killing off the nests completely and preventing them from relocating.

Granules

By applying granules to the yard, we are able to treat the pests that are not only nesting around the base of your home, but actually IN the grass and yard. We granulate up to 20 feet around the home at EVERY SERVICE using our premium waterproof and SAFE granules.

Dust Injections

Many pests including scorpions and black widows nest inside walls both inside and outside the home where its cool in the summer and warm in the winter. Instead of leaving these unseen dangerous pests alone, we provide an extra service that specifically targets these areas. Our dust quickly spreads to even the smallest spaces inside block walls and power outlets where liquid product can’t, killing any unwanted pests and preventing them from returning.

360 Interior + garage

At Emerald, family and safety are our top priorities. We use only the safest product inside the home, not the cheapest. We mix our product with exact measurements and do not dilute it - keeping your family and pets SAFE and your home PEST FREE. Our interior service treats with pin point accuracy 360 around the entire interior of the home AND garage.

De-Web

While treating pests in and around the home is key, we also treat pests living ON your home. At every service we provide FREE web and nest knockdown around the highest and lowest points of the home. These nests and webs often times contain pests hiding and egg sacks that haven't yet hatched. Our equipment can reach up to 3-stories high so that we can ensure the removal of all webs and nests.
